Write-Up: Using GitHub Task Manager to Manage the Tools for a House-Building Project
I managed the house-building project with GitHub Projects. I was able to assign roles, divide up the project into manageable chunks, establish deadlines, and monitor progress with a Kanban-style board that had columns labeled "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

Stages and Assignments
There were four primary phases of the project:

Pre-construction: Materials procurement and surveying.
Foundation: Putting the groundwork and foundation in place.
Building walls and setting up electrical and plumbing systems constitute structural construction.
Finishing: Getting things done both inside and outside.


Every activity was given a time limit and a role (for example, "Mary" for the survey), and the board was used to monitor each task's progress.

The Use of the To Do Table
GitHub Projects' To Do table was a lifesaver when it came to remembering what needed to be done. It gave me a clear picture of every assignment that was ahead of me, which helped me prioritize them correctly and make sure nothing got overlooked. Through phased task organization and placement in the To Do column, I was able to quickly identify what needed to be done next.

Benefits of Project Management
All things considered, utilizing GitHub Projects made it simple to arrange assignments, establish due dates, and track the project's development visually. The capacity to move activities across columns offered a straightforward yet efficient means of monitoring the project and ensuring that everything went according to plan.
